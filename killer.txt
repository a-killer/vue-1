Vue Starter Template
A full-featured Webpack setup with hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing & css extraction, plus few opinionated configurations on top of the cake.

This template is Vue 2.0 compatible.

Usage
This is a project template for vue-cli. It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.

$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init netguru/vue-starter my-project
$ cd my-project
$ yarn
$ yarn dev
This will scaffold the project using the master branch.

The development server will run on port 8080 by default. If that port is already in use on your machine, the next free port will be used.

Webpack + vue-loader for single file Vue components.
